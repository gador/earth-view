Randomly set desktop background from 2000+ images sourced from [Google Earth View](https://earthview.withgoogle.com).

Currently supporting:

- X desktops
- GNOME on Wayland or X11
- KDE on Wayland or X11

> Wayland compositors support will come soon.

## üì• Installation

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è NixOS

#### Flakes (recommended)

```nix
{
  # Use unstable to get latest updates
  inputs.earth-view.url = "github:nicolas-goudry/earth-view";
  # Pin to a given revision
  #inputs.earth-view.url = "github:nicolas-goudry/earth-view/8c193eeb245cf4b5394f6441d31728775657a80a";
  # Optional, follow your nixpkgs input
  #inputs.earth-view.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, earth-view }: {
    nixosConfigurations.yourhostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      # Customize to your system
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
        earth-view.nixosModules.earth-view
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

#### `fetchTarball`

```nix
{ lib, ... }:

{
  imports = let
    # Replace this with an actual commit or tag
    rev = "<replace>";
  in [
    "${builtins.fetchTarball {
      url = "https://github.com/nicolas-goudry/earth-view/archive/${rev}.tar.gz";
      # Replace this with an actual hash
      sha256 = lib.fakeHash;
    }}/modules/nixos"
  ];
}
```

### üè† Home Manager

#### Flakes: NixOS system-wide home-manager configuration

```nix
{
  # Use unstable to get latest updates
  inputs.earth-view.url = "github:nicolas-goudry/earth-view";
  # Pin to a given revision
  #inputs.earth-view.url = "github:nicolas-goudry/earth-view/8c193eeb245cf4b5394f6441d31728775657a80a";
  # Optional, follow your nixpkgs input
  #inputs.earth-view.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, home-manager, earth-view }: {
    nixosConfigurations.yourhostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      # Customize to your system
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
        home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager {
          home-manager.sharedModules = [
            inputs.earth-view.homeManagerModules.earth-view
          ];
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

#### Flakes: Configuration via home.nix

```nix
{ inputs, ... }:

{
  imports = [
    inputs.earth-view.homeManagerModules.earth-view
  ];
}
```

#### `fetchTarball`: Configuration via home.nix

```nix
{ lib, ... }:

{
  imports = let
    # Replace this with an actual commit or tag
    rev = "<replace>";
  in [
    "${builtins.fetchTarball {
      url = "https://github.com/nicolas-goudry/earth-view/archive/${rev}.tar.gz";
      # Replace this with an actual hash
      sha256 = lib.fakeHash;
    }}/modules/home-manager"
  ];
}
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

```nix
{
  # Default values
  services.earth-view = {
    enable = false;
    interval = null;
    imageDirectory = ".earth-view";
    display = "fill";
    enableXinerama = true;
  }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Currently, the systemd service is not automatically started. To manually start it, you can use the following command after applying your configuration:
>
> ```shell
> systemctl --user start earth-view.timer
> ```
>
> If that does not work or you would like to manually switch the background you can start/restart the main service:
> ```shell
> systemctl --user start earth-view
> ```
>

### `enable`

Whether to enable Earth View service.

Note, if you are using NixOS and have set up a custom desktop manager session for Home Manager, then the session configuration must have the `bgSupport` option set to `true` or the background image set by this module may be overwritten.

### `interval`

The duration between changing background image. Set to `null` to only set background when logging in. Should be formatted as a [duration understood by systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.time.html#Parsing%20Time%20Spans).

### `imageDirectory`

The directory to which background images should be downloaded, relative to `$HOME`.

### `display`

Display background images according to this option. See [`feh` documentation](https://man.archlinux.org/man/feh.1.en#BACKGROUND_SETTING) for details.

> [!NOTE]
> This option has no effect neither on GNOME nor KDE.

### `enableXinerama`

Will place a separate image per screen when enabled, otherwise a single image will be stretched across all screens.

> [!NOTE]
> This option has no effect neither on GNOME nor KDE.

## üßê How it works

### Source of truth

All discovered images URLs from Earth View are saved in [`_earthview.txt`](./_earthview.txt), which is the source of truth of this module.

To create this file, we use a small [Go module](./src/scraper/main.go) which scrapes the Earth View static assets in order to find valid images URLs. If you want to use it locally:

```shell
# Use go
go run ./scraper

# Use a devshell
nix develop # ...or nix-shell
ev-scraper

# Run via nix
nix run '.#ev-scraper'

# Build it
nix build '.#ev-scraper' # ...or nix-build -A ev-scraper
./result/bin/ev-scraper
```

### Image selection

To select an image, a random line from the source of truth is read and a [Go module](./src/fetcher/main.go) is used to download it and save it to the `imageDirectory` directory. The need for a Go module comes from the fact that Earth View exposes images as JSON object with a `dataUri` key containing the base64 encoded image. It also contribute to reduce Bash usage.

### systemd

Both modules use a systemd user-managed unit, along with a timer when `interval` is specified.

The service executes a Bash script which uses the Go module described in the previous section to fetch the image and then set the desktop background accordingly. Read further for more details.

### Some background

Setting the background depends on the desktop manager in use. We detect the current desktop environment with the `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` environment variable and set the background with the right program:

- GNOME on Wayland or X11: `gsettings`
- KDE on Wayland or X11: `plasma-apply-wallpaperimage`
- X: [`feh`](https://github.com/derf/feh)

Why not only use `feh`, would you ask? Well, as of today it does not support setting the GNOME background image. [And it may not ever support it](https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/225). It seems that it also does not work with KDE. And obviously it does not work with Wayland compositors.

## üé© Acknowledgments

This module is heavily based on the [`random-background` service](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/9f9e277b60a6e6915ad3a129e06861044b50fdf2/modules/services/random-background.nix) of [`home-manager`](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), by [rycee](https://github.com/rycee).

The idea to create this module was triggered by the [Google Earth Wallpaper Gnome extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1295/google-earth-wallpaper/), which is not anymore compatible with Gnome 45 or Gnome 46.

Last but not least, this would not be possible without the great [Google Earth View](https://earthview.withgoogle.com) website and the [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh).

## üìù TODO

- [ ] üèó Setup Github Actions to update the image URLs source file
- [ ] ‚ú® Add support for all Wayland compositors with [`swaybg`](https://github.com/swaywm/swaybg)
- [ ] ‚ú® Add `autoStart` option to enable and start the systemd services
- [ ] üßπ Add `autoGC` option to enable images garbage collection
- [ ] üì° Make sure network is up to avoid image download failure
