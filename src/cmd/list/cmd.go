Description:
  This command will try to fetch images from gstatic.com using a known range of
  possible identifiers and generate a JSON array of valid identifiers for images.

  If the fetch succeeds, the image is added to the list.
  If the fetch fails with a 404 HTTP status code, the image is skipped.
  If the fetch fails with a non 200 HTTP status code, the error is reported and
  the image is skipped.

  By default, the generated list is output to the standard output. This
  behaviour can be changed by using the '--output' flag. If the provided value
  is a directory, the file will be named 'earth-view.json'.`,
